In this homework we have built the dataset on which we have done our search engine on our own.
We built our dataset from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/), in particular we focused on ["Top anime list"](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php).

### The repository consists of the following files:

1. __`main.ipynb`__: 
	> The main file of the repository containing all the runned cells and the relative outputs for each request

2. __`functions.py`__: 
	> This script contains all the functions that we used in the main.ipynb notebook

3. __`Questions.md`__: 
	> A Markdown file containing the questions of the homework
	
4. __`Submit.md`__: 

	> A Markdown file containing the istructions for the project submit
